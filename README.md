BCHS is a software stack consisting of the BSD operating system
(OpenBSD, in this case), the C programming environment, the
[httpd](https://bsd.plumbing/) web server, and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).  It's a rock-solid platform.

This repository consists of a lot of static XML files, all licensed

some source code.  I specifically don't attach a license to the source
code because it's boilerplate.

This repository is a read-only mirror of a private CVS repository.
